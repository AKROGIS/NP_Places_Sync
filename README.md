NP_Places_Sync
==============

An internal Park Serivce project to sync authoritative *Places of Interest* maintained in the 
Alaska Region enterprise GIS system with with the crowd sourced data in the
[NP Places](http://www.nps.gov/poi) ([link for Park Service](http://insidemaps.nps.gov/places/)) project.

The code and documentation in this repo is primarily the efforts from the Alaska Region.
It may eventually be merged with additional efforts from the National Team.
